Minus vs Plus Rulebook

StoryLine: Two players take turns moving their pieces on a board while performing arithmetic
operations of addition and subtraction of integers between -6 and 6. 

Objective: Reach a score equal to or greater than 24 before the opponent, by subtracting
numerical values between pieces or getting them to the last row of the board. 

Components:
A six-by-six-square board; twelve positive-sign pieces; twelve negative-sign pieces; six zero- value pieces; a die (optional); and a scoreboard (optional). 

Setting Up:
Each player places his pieces in two parallel rows of six pieces each. Each piece is die-shaped
and have six different numerical values depicted on its sides. At the begining of the game, there
must always be two pieces of each value on each side of the board. The value of a piece is the
one that is depicted on the upper side of that piece. A player will control the positive pieces and his opponent will control the negative ones. The placement of the pieces on the board can be done in the following way:
Basic setting up: the players will place their pieces on their respective first rows with ascending
values from 1 to 6 (and from -1 to -6), following the order indicated by the series of numbers
represented at both ends of the board; and they will follow the same method in the second row, but increasing the values of the pieces in the opposite direction to that of the first row. 

Game Play:
The game starts when the player who put the first piece on the board makes his first move with any of his pieces; to which his opponent will respond with another move of one of his pieces. Each player can make only one move per turn. The pieces can be moved in seven different ways, which are: 
 Forward: Players will not be able to jump to other pieces or perform addition or
subtraction operations when making this kind of movement and they will only be able to
move one square at a time. 
 To the two sides (2 directions): Players will be able to move their pieces to both sides
without jumping over other pieces or performing addition or subtraction operations with
them when performing these movements; however, they will not be able to perform
lateral movements in two consecutive turns, having to advance at least one piece on the
board between one lateral movement and another. Lateral movements, on the other
hand, may be carried out covering the entire width of the board up to either of its two
ends. 
 Diagonally and always forward (2 directions) but jumping to a piece of the same sign in
each movement, advancing two squares at a time. 
 Diagonally and always forward (2 directions) but attacking an opposing piece or
combining with one of the same sign (performing a subtraction or addition operation
with another piece). 

If two pieces of the same sign meet in the same square, as a result of a diagonal movement
made by one of them, then an addition operation between the values of both pieces must occur
unless said sum produces a result greater than 6 or less than -6, in which case the movement
cannot be made. Addition operations can only be performed as a result of a diagonal move, either by advancing a square or jumping over another piece. If two pieces of different signs meet in the same square, as a result of a diagonal movement
made by one of them, then a subtraction operation between the values of both pieces must
occur. Subtraction operations can only be performed as a result of a diagonal movement, either
by advancing a square or jumping over another piece. When an addition or subtraction operation occurs between two pieces, the result of said
operation must be the value of the piece remaining in the square where the operation occurred. If a subtraction operation between two pieces results in a numerical value equal to zero, then
both pieces are replaced by a neutral piece of zero value. The zero-valued pieces cannot be
moved by either of the two players nor can they be jumped by their respective pieces, but they
can be captured by them by executing diagonal moves. If a zero-valued piece is captured by another, then it is replaced by it in the same square where
the capture occurs. As a result of this action, the player who makes the capture adds a new piece of
his to the board, placing it in the first row of the board and on the square marked with the same
modular value of the piece with which the capture was made. If this square was already
occupied by another piece, then both should be added together if possible or, otherwise, no
value will be added to the board. If a piece is placed by a player in the last row of the board (which is his opponent's first), then it
must be returned to the first row of the board and placed in the square corresponding to its
modular value. If this last square is already occupied by another piece, then their values should
be added if possible, otherwise the first piece will leave the board. The player who performs
these actions will get points accordingly. 

Scoring:
There are two ways to get points in this game, they are as follows:
 By subtracting between the values of two pieces of different signs, the attacking player
being the one who gets the points in all cases. The amount of points obtained by said
player will be equivalent to the smallest modular value between those of both pieces if
they are different and, if they are the same, the number of points obtained will be
equivalent to said modular value. 
 By placing pieces on the last row of the board, which will give the player who performs
one of these moves an amount of points equal to the modular value of the piece with
which he performed it. 

Winning:
The winner of a game will be the one who first reaches a score equal to or greater than 24
points. However, there will also be a way to draw in this game: if a player is unable to make any moves
on his corresponding turn, then the game will be decided in either of the following two ways
depending on the case:
The players will tie the game if their scores are tied or if the score favors the player who was
immobilized. The game will end in favor of the player opposite to the one who was immobilized if that player
was the one who was winning. In all cases, the difference between the respective scores of both players will determine the
value of each victory.
If after 80 turns none of the above conditions end the game, the winner will be determined based on the highest current score at 
the end of the 80th turn. In case the scores are equal the match is a draw.
